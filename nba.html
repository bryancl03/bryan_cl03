        <h1 align="center">Boston Celtics vs Los Angeles Lakers</h1>
        
        <h2>
        <p>Celtics vs Lakers first meeting was in 1948 back when the Lakers were from Minnesota, a rivalry that 
        was more dominant for the Celtics with having the all time championship winner Bill Russell, were the Celtics
        and Lakers met in the post season for 7 times and the Celtics winning all of them. It took another couple years 
        until this rivalry revieved but the hatred between 2 fan base grew more, which was the Magic vs Bird era. A rivalry between
        2 all time greatest baskteball players between the 1980s till the 1990s where it was an automatic that 
        both these teams would meet in the finals but unforunately they only met 3 times with the Lakers having the advantage
        2-1.</p>
        
        <p>Now in then modern era this rivalry is not as great as the 2000s when it was Paul Pierce vs Kobe Bryant
        is still the biggest rivalry between 2 teams having 360 meetings and Boston winning 201 to 159. And with the championships
        won would go towards the Celtics with 17 to 16 where as of right now the Celtics having a better chance for the future to 
        get more titles than the Lakers.</p>
        
        <p>There was about 14 players that have played for both the Lakers and Celtics a few notable people who played on both teams are:
        Shaquille O Neal, Gary Payton, Rich Fox and Brian Shaw</p>
