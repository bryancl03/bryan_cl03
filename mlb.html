        <h1 align="center">Boston Red Sox vs New York Yankees</h1>
        
        <h2>
        <p>This can be traced back till April 26, 1901 their first meeting in Baltimore but the hatred towards
        each other was from the two cities hating each other. At first the Red Sox had the upper hand winning the 
        inaugural Series, but until 1919 everything changed. Boston did what is now known the worst deal in baseball
        and maybe in sports of all time selling the best player to their hated rivals the Yankees. It brought upon
        what people call the curse of the bambino where the Redsox's went from 1920 to 2003 where the Redsox would not
        win a championship while the Yankees at the time won 26 World Championships.</p>
        
        <p>For over 116 years this rivalry have met 2,212 time with the Yankees having the advantage with almost 200
        wins over the Redsox's and with the Yankees having an advantage in the post season as well 2-1 and even though
        these two teams are not as great as they used to be this is a match that is still watch, even for a non baseball person
        like me</p>
        
        <p>There was about 27 players who played for both franchises with notable names such as: Babe Ruth, Carlos Rodriguez,
        Alfredo Aceves, and Ramiro Mendoza</p>
