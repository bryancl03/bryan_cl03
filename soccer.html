        <h1 align="center">Barcelona vs Real Madrid</h1>
        
        <h2>
        <p>Maybe one of the most important games in football history and even more now since
        its where 2 of the greatest football players face Lionel Messi vs Cristiano Ronaldo, this game is
        not only the most viewed annual sporting event but also one the best games in the world of football.
        This can be traced all the way to 1943 where Real Madrid beat Barcelona 11-1. At the time Real Madrid 
        was the dominant team in Spain with having the most income of any team. But as of recent years Barcelona was 
        on top ever since the take over from Pep Guardiola where it was known that Barcelona would win. Where the rivalry
        grew the most was when Real Madrid was able to sign the all time greatest footballer at the time Alfredo Di Stefano
        everyone at the time though he would be signing with Barcelon but in 1953 he choosed Real Madrid.</p>
        
        <p>The two teams have faced including friendlies for more than 269 times with Barcelona having the advantage with 111 to 95.
        Now although they have faced many finals it's always a war match where in 2011 it was a huge month because the two teams were to 
        face 4 times with 2 different cups in stake where if I am not mistaken Barcelona took both of those games. This is a game where history
        will always be repeated from both teams but it is one of the most entertainment games of all time</p>
        
        <p>There was about 33 players who played for both Real Madrid and Barcelona with notable players like: Ronaldo, Gheorghe Hagi, 
        Luis Enrique, Dani Garci and Samuel Eto'o. </p>
