        <h2>
        <p>Even though there isn't a known game that could be considered the greatest rivalry
        in ever website that I looked up at this rivalry would be the top 5, their first meeting was 
        September 8, 1996 where the Steelers won. In 2015 according to Bleacher Report
        was ranked #1 in rivalry in NFL but where it was known the most was in 2009 NFL season where they would
        face for the wildcard for the postseason and where the Ravens took it 20-17. Even the 2 QB have said that the win
        doesn't feel the same if they are facing each other which is Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger vs 
        Ravens Joe Flacco.</p>
        
        <p>They have met for 47 times now with the Steelers having the advantage 26 to 21 and when they met in the finals
        the Steelers also have the advantage with 3-0. And as a side note it is also known as the most 
        bloody game with Ray Lewi's hard hitting shots to Bart Scotts hit that almost injured Big Ben</p>
        
        <p>As far as my research so far there is only one player who played for both teams and that is Mike Wallace</p>
